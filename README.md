zipcodes-normals-stations.txt

This file maps weather stations to their zip codes and locations. Each line contains:

- A station ID (starting with "RQC")
- A zip code (like "00674")
- A location name (like "Manati")

```

dly-tmax-normal.txt

This file contains daily maximum temperature normals (historical averages) for each day of each month at different weather stations. The format is:

- Station ID (like "AQW00061705")
- Month (like "01" for January)
- Daily temperature values for each day of the month (1-31)

The values are in tenths of degrees Fahrenheit. For example, "875C" means 87.5Â°F with a "C" flag indicating complete data (all 30 years were used to calculate this average).

Special values like "-8888" indicate dates that don't exist (like February 30th).

The "C" flag after each temperature indicates the data quality - in this case, "complete" meaning all 30 years of the 1981-2010 period were used to calculate the normal temperature for that day.

The station inventories section mentions that station IDs follow a pattern where "the first two characters denote the FIPS country code, the third character is a network code that identifies the station numbering system used." So US* stations are domestic ones we care about?

US has maybe 43k zip codes (TODO verify). temp data has 90k lines (12 per station) and zip data has almost 10k.

How does this have values like 120 days in january? It's like this is a sum over 30 years not an average, avg would be 4 days in jan?


## TODO

Use heat index and windchill

Use counties not zips. Use nearest station for each county.

there's about 40k zipcodes with fairly complex shape data, makes the maps really large and not very usable.

Maybe a higher DPI png that then goes through more compression could give us better image sizes? Right now they're at 11M/18M for png/svg. That's huge and is really laggy to view. But I've seen PNGs of US maps that are less than 1MB and look great so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here. 

Instead I have a couple ideas. There's about 3 million square miles in the lower 48. A 10x10 mile square is 100 square miles, so there's about 30k of these. That would be fewer than the zipcodes, but probably look better and be MUCH better in the SVG because the shapes are way simpler. 

Alternatively a county map could be nice. Looks like there's about 3k counties so this would be 10x as performant as zip code shapes. 

`pytest .` to run tests.
